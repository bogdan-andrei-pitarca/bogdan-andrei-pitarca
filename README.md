# ***About Me*** ðŸŒ±
Hello and welcome! My name is Pitarca Bogdan-Andrei, and I am currently in my sophomore year of studying Computer Science at BabeÈ™-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca. Seeing as I have always held an affinity towards coding, problem-solving and anything related to logical thinking, I aspire to continue down this path and persevere as best I can so that my impact can be felt.

# ***My Mission*** ðŸ”Ž
- Delve deeper into the world of back-end computer programming and software engineering.
- Work on personal coding projects and build a portfolio.
- Deepen my programming skills and broaden my language repertoire, in order to apply these competencies in real-world situations.
